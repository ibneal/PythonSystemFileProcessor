to be kissed—as no doubt it[Pg 98] was; all kinds of good little dots about

ever going to benefit Us with it.'
'I have no patience with him,' observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's
niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.

angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always.

with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.'
