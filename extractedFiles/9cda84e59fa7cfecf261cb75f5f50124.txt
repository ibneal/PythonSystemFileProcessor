shovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the[Pg 89] Cratchit family
drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half
a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.
Two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.
These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden
goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while
the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob
proposed:
'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'
Which all the family re-echoed.
'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.
He sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held
his withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to
keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.
'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell
me if Tiny Tim will live.'
'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,
and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows
remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'
