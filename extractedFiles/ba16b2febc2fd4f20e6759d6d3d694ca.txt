[Pg 29]
'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,' Scrooge observed in a
business-like manner, though with humility and deference.

'Seven years dead,' mused Scrooge. 'And travelling all the time?'
'The whole time,' said the Ghost. 'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture
of remorse.'
'You travel fast?' said Scrooge.
'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost.
