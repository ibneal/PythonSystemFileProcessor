windows; and found that everything could yield him[Pg 144] pleasure. He had
never dreamed that any walk—that anything—could give him so much
happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's
house.
He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and
knock. But he made a dash and did it.
'Is your master at home, my dear?' said Scrooge to the girl. 'Nice girl!
Very.'
'Yes, sir.'
'Where is he, my love?' said Scrooge.
'He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you
upstairs, if you please.'
'Thankee. He knows me,' said Scrooge, with his hand already on the
dining-room lock. 'I'll go in here, my dear.'
He turned it gently, and sidled his face in round the door. They were
looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these
young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see
that everything is right.
'Fred!' said Scrooge.
Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had
forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the
footstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.
'Why, bless my soul!' cried Fred, 'who's that?'



"It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will
you let me in, Fred?"
