'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?

'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be

'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.

Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
stake of holly through his heart. He should!'
