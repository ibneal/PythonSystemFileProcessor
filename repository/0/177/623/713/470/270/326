its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.[Pg 31]
'At this time of the rolling year,' the spectre said, 'I suffer most.
Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,
and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a
poor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have
conducted me?'
Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this
rate, and began to quake exceedingly.
'Hear me!' cried the Ghost. 'My time is nearly gone.'
'I will,' said Scrooge. 'But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery,
Jacob! Pray!'
'How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may
not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.'
It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the
perspiration from his brow.
'That is no light part of my penance,' pursued the Ghost. 'I am here
to-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my
fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.'
'You were always a good friend to me,' said Scrooge. 'Thankee!'
'You will be haunted,' resumed the Ghost, 'by Three Spirits.'
