excitement[Pg 52]—
'Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'
Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which
pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his
capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his
organ of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,
jovial voice—
'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!'
Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,
accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.
'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost. 'Bless me, yes.
There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,
dear!'
'Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,
Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old
Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, 'before a man can say Jack
Robinson!'
You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into
the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had 'em up in their
places—four, five, six—barred 'em and pinned 'em—seven, eight,
nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like
racehorses.
